Iron Man Jarvis AI Desktop Voice Assistant| Python
Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.


What can this A.I. assistant do for you?
It can send emails on your behalf.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
It is capable of opening websites like Google, Youtube, etc., in a web browser.
It is capable of opening your code editor or IDE with a single voice command.

Is it an A.I.?
Many people will argue that the virtual assistant that we have created is not an A.I, but it is the output of a bunch of the statement. 
But, if we look at the fundamental level, the sole purpose of A.I develop machines that can perform human tasks with the same effectiveness or even more effectively than humans.

It is a fact that our virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.!
